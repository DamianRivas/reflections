When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would always want to keep a remote repository because I tend to work from more than one
computer. It's also useful when collaborating with other people because we can each work
from our own machines instead of sharing one to work locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I wouldn't want Git to override changes that I've made locally that haven't been pushed
to the remote repository and this is also an aspect that I want to have complete control
of because Git isn't intelligent enough to handle all possible conflicts that may arise.
