What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

When you initialize a repository, the computer adds a folder called .git to the current
directory. This needs to be done in order to save versions of the current directory using Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

The staging area is a sort of temporary location where files from the working directory that
are to be committed are added to in preparation to a commit on the repository. It's valuable
because it gives us the ability to specifically choose which files we want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the staging area to make sure I am only committing the files that I want to commit
per logical change. First I only add the specific files I want to the staging area, then I
check the differences between the working directory and the staging area, and the staging area
and the master head to ensure that I am only making the changes appropriate to the logical
change. Then I commit the changes from the staging area to the repository.
